# Mid-term 
Do the connected or the absence of method. 
Bundles are not good.
* Citizens Without Nations: Urban Citizenship in Europe and the World, C.1000-1789 
	* Its a bit of global history and definitely comparative history
	* Look at every thing we have discussed and then evaluate how/if the book
Argument. Tries in the last third of the book to do some comparative stuff. 
Societies
European
Sacred kingship
are the choices not great for comparison 
# [[goldstoneDatingGreatDivergence2021]]
- Lesson: eurocentric
- Economic historians 
- How do you even measure gdp back then 
- It is an example of Competition history
- Be careful with generalization 
# [[conradWhatGlobalHistory2017]]
* Global cosmology can e aplied for ever nation 
* its not physical but the metaphicisical and how they see themselves
* Gives warnings about global history. 
* At the very end gave some good examples at the end 
# [[osterhammelGlobalHistoryHistorical2016]]
* Descriptive
* Apparently does not explain the dangers 
	* Asymetric comparison 
# [[pennockGlobalizingCosmologies2018]]
* The examples that they chose*
	* Is the example relevant --> 
* Comparative history work that still says its doing a global history --> They are doing comparative history. 
* Mentions [[conradWhatGlobalHistory2017]]
* Medievalists want to say "we have a global turn" 
	* Redefine what is global 
		* World as created through connections
	* Chose objects or people that traveled around the world. 
# [[conradWhatGlobalHistory2017]]
* Buc likes Conrad
* Connected history is much harder because you have to master the context to give explanation for items traveling. 
* Go beyond causality 
	* The early stuff is causal, like Max webber who look at stuff before. Conrad disagrees but he think that we still need causality. connected histories for him with their chains do not work as causes, he says we need to bring causality back into the chains. 
* Explains better [[subrahmanyamConnectedHistoriesNotes1997]]

# Laundry list 
* Is the book presenting is a classic rise of the west narrative, multiple modernities perspective, etc. 
* Being aware of your bias: Do not make a comparison betweeen two different areas just bc of a pre-determined points. 
	* Leaving out certain things
	* Choice of the units of comparison need to be concrete, and balanced understanding. With good sources. 
		* No german people no dutch people 
		* There needs to be a basis for comparison 
* Note: Object of comparison does not need to be a human 
* Asymetrical comparison 
	* Good heuristics need to be done and acknowledged. 
* Self-reflexivity 
	* Do not just reflect on your work but also make sure that you reflect on how your own experience, the things you pick. 
	* Try to look identify of the historians decisions and are within a context. ==Make sure you do not imagine biases though==. 
	* Connected history: Re-adjust your relation to the object. 
* Comparisons are diachronic or synchronic comparisons. 
	* synchronic: freezing it in time. not super useful for global history. [[osterhammelGlobalHistoryHistorical2016]]. 
		* How can you compare them if they are differing in time space 
	* Diachronic: 
		* Risk: Teleology. 
		* Is this comparison or just narrative history 
		* 
			* Runs the risk of narrativization. 
		* 
* Global history
	* The subject is either too broad or too narrow. Freibergers discussion on scale is interesting for macro, micro etc scale. 
* Be aware of the periodization you use [[osterhammelGlobalHistoryHistorical2016]]. 
	* Dont take early moderrn age as aunit becaus it is not the best label.
	* The time frame used might also not be suitable across regions. 
	* Make sure that you if you are cocmparing socieities, like the aztecs you can compare it with other socieities in time but you cannot compare it with demographics, economies etc. There needs to be a basis of comparison for both of these. 
*  Zimmerman
	* The historization of categories.
	* CAn you talk about kingship across different times [[BlochMarc2022ACTa]]
* Narrow national views and items, go beyond modern state borders. 
	* Be ready to bring other disciplines into the research. 
* The alleged continuation of terms and definitions. 
* Look at change within the objects of comparison
	* You can compare units and how they've changed --> Processes of change. French Revolution and English revolution. 
* Movement and change 
	* Why and when does china suddenly take serious the american expansion into hawai 
Do not use all of the laundry list lmao .
