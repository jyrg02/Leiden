> This article presents, in a programmatic way, the histoire croisée approach, its methodological implications and its empirical developments. Histoire croisée draws on the debates about comparative history, transfer studies, and connected or shared history that have been carried out in the social sciences in recent years. It invites us to reconsider the interactions between different societies or cultures, erudite disciplines or traditions (more generally, between social and cultural productions). Histoire croisée focuses on empirical intercrossings consubstantial with the object of study, as well as on the operations by which researchers themselves cross scales, categories, and viewpoints. The article first shows how this approach differs from purely comparative or transfer studies. It then develops the principles of pragmatic and reflexive induction as a major methodological principle of histoire croisée. While underlining the need and the methods of a historicization of both the objects and categories of analysis, it calls for a reconsideration of the way history can combine empirical and reflexive concerns into a dynamic and flexible approach.  

Changes have occurred. Two reasons 
1. Political: Increased globalization affecting the world around us, in the physical and action
2. Internal/Intellectual: Culturalist turn towards specificiy and bringing about knowledge fragmentation 
Usage of histore croisée: 
* Groups of histories that look at specific intersections/crossings 
* Study of social, political and cultural formations (national) 
Preliminary remarks: 
1. Belongs to a group of approaches that looks at historically constituted units 
2. Discusses the relation between comparison and transfers
3. Historizes objects, categories of analysuis and relationships between research and unit of study 
# Comparison 
Issue with comparison: The issue opf self-monitoring and readjustum,ent 
Base questions: 
1. Position of the observer: The researcher is always involved in some way or another. It is impossible to adopt  complete external view to the units being compared. 
2. Scale of comparison: Which scale is chosen. In concepts such as nation-states or civilization.
3. Defining the object of comparison/unit: Which definition of the object is used.[^1] It is important to historize the object of comparison. 
4. Synchronic vs diachronmic logics: Comparative assume syncronic cross overs.[^2] They need to fix the object in time
5. The interaction among the objects of comparison: Sometimes one object modifies or is modified by the other 
# Transfers
Diachronic perspective
Study on the process of transformation 
Issues
1. Frames of reference: Implies a beginning and an end for the time analyzed. 
2. Invariability of the categories of analysis: Categories used are nationally contextualized. These categories are thought to be static 
3. Reflexivity deficit:  
4. Reciprocity and reversibility: The somewhat linear approach simplifies cases and interacts with things from many different directions and therefore reproduction is very hard. ==frameworks are needed to provide reciprocal opportunities, this is what history crosée attempts to do==
# Inter-crossing (histoire crosée)
Meaning: "To place or fold crosswise over the other" [^3]
Requires active observer to construct the movements and the relation between researcher and object are also worth examining (p. 39)
Intersection is essential --> Consequences: 
1. Acknowledges plurality and configurations from it. Objects are looked through one another, in the relationships, interactions and circulations 
2. Looks at the consequences of intercrossing 
	1. Base assumption: Things happen when the crossing process occurs 
3. Crossing interweaves and looks art resistances, inertias, modifications, in trajectory form and content 
4. The units under study do not remain intact: Transformations can result from reciprocity but also from asymetry, setting it apart from intermixing.[^4] ==intercrossing is interested in the original and new elements that are produced and how they are affected by each of the parties==
Types of intercrossing: 
1. Related to the object of research: Empirical grounding and constitute the object of research. 
2. Viewpoints/ways of looking at the object: 
3. Observer and object (issue of reflexivity)
