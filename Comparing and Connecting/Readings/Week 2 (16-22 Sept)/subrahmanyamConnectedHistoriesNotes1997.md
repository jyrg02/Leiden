The early modern period: Middle 14th cent to mid 18th cent

>* Millenarian beliefs prompted people. For example Columbus moved by this belief --> The birth of modernity was due to a medieval view of the world (p. 749) 
>* The period prompted new conditions for its (millienarian) rise and had different manifestations
* Rhythms between northern and southern of Europe were linked by culture.[^1]
* Different conceptions in the middle east 
	* Ottoman, Iran and Northern Africa - Reordering of the known world through the mujaddid
	* India, Morroco, Sunnis - Paralleled the Indian belief of the Iman Mahdi[^2]
* Ideas evolved and in in 1524 the ruler Tahmasb distanced himself from messianic elements of the concept. [^3]
