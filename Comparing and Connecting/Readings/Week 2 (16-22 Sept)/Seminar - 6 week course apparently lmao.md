We have to provide a dialogue between two books 
* Compare the approaches
* Think about the books and how they use the methods we are using 
* Collective volumes are useful 
* Final is one integrated paper 
Pick up a book, find articles which
* What did they want to do 
* what did they do which made them fail (if they do)
final essay
* Think about your theme 
* You yourself propose on how to organize this
After mid-term 
* Individual consultations with either buc or the other guy 
	* We need to write to them where we want to go 
	* They will discuss the mid-term assignment  
	* Send email to BOTH OF THEM were we discuss the theme --> BY THE WEEKEND SUNDAY WE NEED TO HAVE IT 
		* Informal email: a few hundred words. 
# [[wernerComparisonHistoireCroisee2006]]
* methodology treaty 
France and Germany did not talk about the same things. there is a volume from a while ago where french and german medievalists got together and they tried to view. 
Usefull for its critiques and categorization 
Histoire crosee is more of a compliment but not a methodology itself<--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Would be very descriptive if it would be made into a book 
Can maybe done in very specific context/object like a knife 
- They are both comparative historians --> LMAO :) 
# [[subrahmanyamConnectedHistoriesNotes1997]]
* He shits on comparative history. Especially the natioanlistic perspective 
* He hates lieberman because of the causes
	* Chain of events, 
	* 


# Difference between croisee and subrahmanyam
They tend to used hand in hand 
* beginig point and end point --> Subrahanmayan
* werner --> Looking at specific points 
* Certain terms are not examined, they are treated as static and as a unit. For example milleniarism 
* Subrahmanyan would look at the archeology of the people working in the fields (in the ottoman, etc) and look at how they have studied it and make sure it does not interlap with western conceptions. 
	* histoire corse woud look at geneology of the data, reflexivity and certain notice towards this. 
	* while connected histories
# Friedman
