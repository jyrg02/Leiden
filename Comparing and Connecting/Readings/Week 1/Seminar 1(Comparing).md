Laundry list: 
* Is there comparability between the two subjects: Are they close? Basis for comparison? 
	* Time period: Make sure that they are somewhat similar from the same period 
	* Proximity in place, time[^1]
* Overfocus on national boundaries and cultural transfers 
* To avoid bias one must have self-awareness 
	* Problems with applying method do not disregard the method 
* Units of comparison: Need to be defined concretely 
	* Languages
	* Cultures
	* Trade (jobs)
	* Social relations
* How to strike a balance: 
* Development of the borgoise: 
* Which units of comparisons: They need to test your hypothesis. 
	* It is not the same to compare the developement and power of the buroigse, if you compare french and german boirgoise and their power vs russia and german burgoise bc each one will give you very different results. One must avoid confirmation bias. 
* Divergence debate[^2]: Arises from asymetric comparison. Not define units of comparison as opposed to each other. 
	* Orientalism is also asymetric comparison. 
	* Shoemakers - there is no focus on other trades  
* Hobs: Diachronic comparisons.

# Footnotes

[^1]: Although according to our teacher we can compare 15th cent jp and 16th cent eur
[^2]: Webber tries to explain why europe is the first industralizing and democracy. This position is strong and shared in the 20th century and manifest destiny of europea and gets critized. Webber does not give enough time or attention in the non-european world. historians later say that (LA school of commerance) that say asia does not modernize but because of contact with european colonialism and the advantages of such elements. there has been comparisons gathered with moe and more data. you cannot compare china and western europe. You cannot say western europe vs western china, you need to specify. Now a days people compare southern british ports. The debate now a days lies in Did the story begin during the middle ages or is this a consequence of napoleonics?
