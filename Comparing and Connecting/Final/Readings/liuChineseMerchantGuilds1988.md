Merchant guilds are first --> 18th cent 
* Craft guilds were not concerned with the staples of handicraft production 
	* tuanhang, associated with government p. 5 [[moll-murataMerchantCraftGuilds2018]]
* Hard to compare in terms of government interaction 
* 11th to 13th cent China experiences urbanization and commerical growth. 
* During the Song Dynasty (960 to 1279) craft organizations leaders were passive and were in the service of the government. Lasted through the Song, Mongol Yan and the Ming (1368-1644). 
	* Technology did not advance p. 7
* The Ming and Qing sees an expansion of commercial economy p. 6
	* Rise of brokerage. 
	* The guild that are born in that era take over the liscences brokers. The term huiguan is born here.
# Merchant guilds (Huiguan)
* Huiguan was adopted by merchants for their ow nassociaitions. 
	* One of the earliest commerical huiguan is a large group of smaller guilds that resided in Beijing but were all from Shanxi. p. 10 
	* It wasnt until 1760 however that Shanxi Merchants built a temple and clubhouse p. 13
		* Has to do with the fact that often wealthy merchants did not need guild protection and purchased government positions. 
* Religion: Once they left their hometowns, distancing themselves from family and lineage they found group in religions and rituals. p. 10 
	* The monopoly of the state over confucianism meant that the  guilds workshiped local and folk dieties. 
	* Because people moved they were not always able to return to their hometowns. As a result the guilds would also be in chrage of burrying or shipping their remains to their native home p. 11
* Not to be mistaken with ritual associatios
* Government
	* Had to contend with the manippulation of the market by government-liscensed brokers. Some guilds engaged in price fixing which was framed as adhering to the common interest, faith to this common interests was essential because otherwise they would fall prey to the government. p. 12

There was dues charged for membership and they usually included worship to a particular deity.
