> [!Abstract]  
>  
> Occupational guilds in medieval and early modern Europe offered an effective institutional mechanism whereby two powerful groups, guild members and political elites, could collaborate in capturing a larger slice of the economic pie and redistributing it to themselves at the expense of the rest of the economy. Guilds provided an organizational mechanism for groups of businessmen to negotiate with political elites for exclusive legal privileges that allowed them to reap monopoly rents. Guild members then used their guilds to redirect a share of these rents to political elites in return for support and enforcement. In short, guilds enabled their members and political elites to negotiate a way of extracting rents in the manufacturing and commercial sectors, rents that neither party could have extracted on its own. First, I provide an overview of where and when European guilds arose, what occupations they encompassed, how large they were, and how they varied across time and space. I then examine how guild activities affected market competition, commercial security, contract enforcement, product quality, human capital, and technological innovation. The historical findings on guilds provide strong support for the view that institutions arise and survive for centuries not because they are efficient but because they serve the distributional interests of powerful groups.

# 1) competition and market structure; 
Each guild possessed legal privileges endowing its members with exclusive rights to practice particular economic activities in a particular geographical area. These privileges typically consisted of a monopoly over producing specific goods and services, together with a monopsony over purchasing particular inputs.
A guild’s exclusive privileges typically applied within a particular geographical area, sometimes consisting only of the town itself, often reaching into its immediate circumference, and sometimes extending more widely across a district or province
s, guilds excluded entrants, restricted trade volumes, set output prices above the competitive level, fixed input costs below the competitive level, and imposed costs on competitors 
Some of a guild’s exclusive entitlements were laid down explicitly, usually in a charter or ordinance issued by the town or state government. But guilds often enforced privileges that were not embodied in any legislation but were simply “well-known” to be part of their entitlements
 Guilds often secured government barriers to trade, as when the Venetian state blocked imports of French mirrors to protect the Murano glassblowers’ guild
 Guilds also obtained direct enforcement of their privileges from municipal and state governments
 The Württemberg state responded to complaints by the retailers’ guild against a converted Jew’s widow by closing down her village shop, or in 1742 when a town court jailed a villager’s wife after a complaint by the local nailsmith that she was “dealing in foreign nails, which violated the nailsmiths’ guild ordinance, and damaged him in his craft”
