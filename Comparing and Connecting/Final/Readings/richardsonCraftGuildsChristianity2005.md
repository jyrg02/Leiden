> [!Abstract]  
>  
> In late-medieval England, craft guilds simultaneously pursued piety and profit. Why did guilds pursue those seemingly unrelated goals? What were the consequences of that combination? Theories of organizational behavior answer those questions. Craft guilds combined spiritual and occupational endeavors because the former facilitated the success of the latter and vice versa. The reciprocal nature of this relationship linked the ability of guilds to attain spiritual and occupational goals. This link between religion and economics at the local level connected religious and economic trends in the wider world.

Most of these guilds enforced government edicts concerning the quality and price of services, and like other businessmen, may have used unsavory tactics to cut costs and raise revenues. 
the way to raise incomes was to limit the number of individuals in an occupation, either by restricting the number of apprenticeships or impeding the immigration of competitors  --> Service
