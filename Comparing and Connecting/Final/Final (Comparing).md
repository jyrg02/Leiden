* General traits and functions that were found among chinese guilds and compare those with praak's discussions of european guilds. 
I am worried regarding scope because 
1. guild developement is a broad time span with guilds evolving and changing 
2. China is a vast territory 
Some recommendations were that i address this is 
1. Focusing on specific characteristics as a way of narrowing down the scope OR focusing on a city 
2. Acknowleding the limitations within the text
Commericial cities 
Does the critieria of praak can be used for chinese case --> THIS IS THE FINAL DECISION. Does not address the issue of scope but perhaps a city 
Can the chinese case be used 
* Alliances and merchants 
* How 
Matrix table for comparison
