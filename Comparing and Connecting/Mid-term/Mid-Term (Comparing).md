Imagined Communities by Anderson is the text this mid-term will analyse. Anderson's works creates a meta-theory which explains the rise of nationalism and provides a specific conceptualization of nations. Particularly Anderson looks at the creation of nationalism as a result of processes like the decline of religion and the rise of modern capitalism.[^1] According to Anderson these processes span the globe and were prerequisite.[^2]. These processes challenged the dynastic and religious foundations upon which power stood, allowing for a new way of thinking.[^3] In effort to build a meta-theory Anderson compares many countries and their circumstances to explain his reasoning. His use of comparative history allows him to explain how these processes took place across the world. The use of comparative history is diachronic and does not stick to one single continent which provides an ample text to analyse. As a compliment I will use Chapter 4 of *Theories of Nationalism* to contextualize Anderson within the larger nationalism scholarship.[^4]
