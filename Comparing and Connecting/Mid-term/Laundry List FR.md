# Comparing 
* Being aware of your bias: Do not make a comparison betweeen two different areas just bc of a pre-determined points. 
* Choice of the units of comparison need to be concrete, and balanced understanding. With good sources. 
	* There needs to be a basis for comparison
* Types of comparison: 
	* Encompassing comparisons: Explaining differences between cases that share general commonalities (*ej: nationalism studies*)--> Not as useful according to Storm
	* Variation-finding: Different cases are understood as one variation of a particular phenomena. 
	* Synchronic comparisons: Concerned with a particular event and ignoring historical antecedents 
	* Diachronic comparisons: Concerned with changes of concepts over a period of time. "Different times for different social contexts". Risk: Teleology + narrativization. 
* Be ware of asymetrical comparisons.
