>Why was urban atuohomy still popular in 1800

# Introduction 
Main arguments:  
1. Citizens were prominent in public life 
2. The French Revolution and its aftermath did not automatically improve citizen's rights and participation --> Strengthened national governments. 
3. Pre-modern urban citizenship had impressive track record
Claims
1. Will look at the development of the citizenship of the premodern era 
2. Features of European citie are also present in the Middle East and China 
3. The supposed features of European cities did not help advance the economic dynamism 
Distinct stages of state-city interactions:
1. States and city were identical (11th to 12th cent). 
2. Urban federation (17th and 18th) 
3. Parliamentary rule (1689)
Methodology 
* Takes cues from historical sociology (p. 13)
* Applies comparative method (p. 14)
	* Universalizing - First half of the book --> Identify legal, political, economic, social and military dimensions of citizenship. 
	* Variation-finding comparison - Second part of book --> why did the same local institutions not produce the same results. 
	* Variation-finding comparison - Third part of the book --> Two asian regions china and the middle east  
Structure 
1. First part: 
	* The thesis of citizens prominent in public life. 
		* Identify legal, political, economic, social and military dimensions of citizenship. 
		* Draws on urban histories from all over Europe
	* Methodology: 
		* Universalizing comparison. 
		* Structure analysis
	* Approach: How certain institutions gave citizens agency. 
	* Structure: 
		2. Ch2: Councils 
		* Guilds
		3. Ch3: Community 
			* Charities 
		4. Ch4: Inclusion and exclusion
2. Second part: 
	* The thesis: The French Revolution and its aftermath did not automatically improve citizen's rights and participation
		* Why did the same local institutions not produce the same results. 
		* Unpack the weberian idea of a single european urban experience 
		* The relation of the community with the state 
		* The embedding of cities within state structures, in certain countries, made it so that urban citizens had less access to state machinery and national politics. 
			* HR, France and Spain
3. Third part: 
	1. The thesis: The supposed features of European cities did not help advance the economic dynamism 
	2. Structure: 
		* Endogenous developments in asia *
## Methodological comments 
1. Acknowledges that citizenship status different between people. 
	1. In those areas citizenship status did indeed distinguish between people.  
2. ==For europe he compares specific cities however when dealing with asia he compares china and the middle east, two very broad regions.== 
	1. Pay attention to how he looks at Asia
3. How do cities and citizenship interact with each other, he also does not define what is a city and their differences. For example in England city status was tied to church presence and was granted by the king. In the Netherlands cities and their rights were tied to lords. 
	1. ==He might actually do this in chapter 8 and 9 so keep a look out for it== 
		1. Look at how he reasons that england was out of the state structure
	2. Keep a look out on how he uses the HRE example.
		1. He states that in Germany, cologne people had to swear an oath of fealty that was actively against the nobility and promised fealty to the city p. 30 
4. There is a difference between citizenship and subject. 
5. He uses the Roman Empire as an example but does not really acknowledge how the Roman Empire was a very different institution, in addition to that the roman empire spanned more than 400 years and 3 different continents.[^1]
6. Does he talk about the different type of citizens throughout the book? 
	1. Jews
	2. Women 
	3. Chrisitians (England, Netherlands)
7. By focusing on citizens he excludes the large group of people who were not citizens of cities, excluding the marginalized. Reinforcing the invisibility of certain groups. 
8. Does he acknolwedges that citizenship changed through time? If he does then it is not really incorbut does not really incororate it into his analysis. The issue is that his basis premise of citizenship and guilds means that needs to trace both the evolution of guilds and citizenship however treats citizenship as a static concept. 
9. In addition the focus on guilds and citizenship means that apprentices without citizenship are left out of the discussion. Which means he leaves on the cutting room floor the greater number of people[^8]
10. He does not discuss how these cities interacted with each other. a lot of them were subject to trade and competed to attract trade and craftsmen. 
## Paper structure
Definition: Fixed in time. He acknowledges the modification of  

# Ch: 1
>[!important] How citizenship became a core element of the urban imageind communities 

Citizenship : 
1. Acces to the guilds and hugh office
2. Formal citizenship was not the same accorss all places.[^2] 
	Hard to achieve sources regarding who left/died --> The authorities were not interested in documenting who left the city therefore a recording of transfers is hard. 

Guilds vs the administration dynamic p. 410 
* Florence
Emdem
# Ch. 2: Councils 
* Makes the point that Barcelona was dominated by nobles. Discusses the Spanish march
* The author looks at guilds in a general way, meaning that when he discusses guilds he does not discuss how they interacted with each other. 
* looks at class. 
* local elites against guilds but does not concrete what he means by urban elites [^3]
# Ch3
Citizenship tied with guilds[^4]
Counters the materialist and marxist analysis.[^5]
Guilds were abolished for politcal reasons[^6]
Acknowledges that guilds were not homogenous and often had conflicting interests[^7]
Discusses how guilds were tied into the commubities through link, he explictely talks of charitable foundation[^9]
