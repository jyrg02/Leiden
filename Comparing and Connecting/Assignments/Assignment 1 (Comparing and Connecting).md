Please write a short QuARP-style analysis of each of the three works listed above for week 1, and make them enter in dialogue. R/MA students should add in the third work cited. Please put all this in a single file, and post on BrightSpace (BS) under "assignments". 

Instead of the ‘problem’ part of the QuARPs, end by briefly (200 words) suggesting a theme where comparison could work well, arguing why you think this is the case. Please use proper English with proper references. That is, write this like a paper, no bullet points. 

Ideally times new romans 12p, double interval, and word or libre office

What is a QuARP?    
This acronym hints at the logical sequence of 1) a QUote or keyquote: a sentence or passage you find particularly relevant for the scholarly work under review. A keyquote does not necessarily cover the main line of the article or chapter, preferably it should NOT be an introductory or summarising remark (below…above, we have…). Please provide full citations (no cuts in the quote); use passages that do not refer explicitly to earlier remarks outside of the quote; do not cite passages where the author quotes others. 2) explain the Argument in which this particular quote plays a role of some importance; note that this does not leave any room for your views: you simply try to reconstruct the author’s position. 3) consider the Relation of this part of the text with the text as a whole (other paragraphs, chapters; or other articles read in the same week, perhaps texts from other parts of our course); here you can develop a more critical and individual position. A normal QuARP would include 4), stating a Problem you have identified in the work, either something you want more information about (factual information I might be able to provide in our meeting), or a shortcoming in the logical or empirical setup of the work. This final component of the QuARP depends wholly on your choices and views, albeit supported by a careful argument.  
Note that in the Qu and A part you strictly follow the author, whereas in the AR and P parts (we are not interested for this specific assignment in the P), you have substantial leeway to show your ideas. Brevity is quality here: a QuARP about one particular text should never take more space than 400 words or one A-4 page, and can be quite effective in 200 words.

## Planning
 This text will perform three QUARPs of the presented readings, wherein the texts will all be compared to each other in different aspects. The aspects discussed will be [insert what subjects each of the QARPS are going to deal with][[1]](#_ftn1). 

Bloch (2021) asserts that historians have abandoned the comparative method. He explains his reasoning as follows “It is no doubt because they have been too easily persuaded that “comparative history” is a chapter of the philosophy of history or of general sociology, and these are disciplines which the historian—according to his cast of mind—either reveres or greets with a skeptical smile, but in general takes good care not to practise; for what he requires of a method is that it should be a tool, in ordinary use, easy to manipulate, and yielding positive results” (p.91).
