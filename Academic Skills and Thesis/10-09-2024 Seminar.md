# How to tackle projects 
1. Not necessary to start with a question 
	1. Start w/ topic and/or problem
2. Think of a problem and have a material in mind while you are developing the question 
	1. Student start having a question, then don't have sources and then either panic and restart or have to shoehorn it 
3. Make it doable. Think of methodology while you are thinking of the question. 
	1. If there is no source material you cannot make answer it lmao.
