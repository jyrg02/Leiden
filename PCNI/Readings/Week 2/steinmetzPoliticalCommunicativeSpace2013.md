Political history comes under attack during the 1970's
* Reasons
	* Fascination with unexplored fields (Gender, class, marginalized groups)
	* Unresponsivness to new metholodologies like discourse analysis
# Historical development (1970-1990)
>[!tip] Overall summary/big takeaways
>Similarities exist: Successive turns have had essential roles. The discipline of pol.hist needs to look beyond leaders and formal political bodies.
>Differences: Focus. 
>* Political historians/Cultural historians of politics - Work on "rather institutive understand of what politics is". Believe that politics concerns itself with how to implement and make decisions. Sometimes adhere to old notions of sovereignty. 
>* New political historians: Problematize everything. Long term and comparative perspective. Bielefeld approach adheres to this. 

> [!recite|background-green] The 70s - Cultural turn
* France
	* Annales school - Reject the positivistic tradition of the French republican history
	* French Right - René Remond *counter the Annales*
		* Defines political as "conquest and exercise and practice of power"
			* Study of history as structures, towards strategies and interrelations
	* Cultural history: Myth making,[^1] revolutionary celebrations.[^2]
* Anglo-American - Less pronounced than France
	* Mildly revisionist from historians
		* Mark H. Leff 
			1. The new methods relied solely on quantitative methods
			2. New intuitionalists were notable, they were trying to explain interactions between the political and the society and civil actors
			3. New trends of historians of marginalized groups seeking to explain institutional and policy changes
* Attacked from the side-lines 
	* Cultural history and comparative history of nation-state building.[^3][^4][^5][^6] 
* Germany and the Sonderweg question 
	* Social historians subscribe to this theory 
	* Attacked from the outside 
		* Alltagsgeschichte [^9] is opened to political questions when considering the attitudes of industrial workers (Eigensinn)
			* ==QUESTION==: How does Alf Lüdtke challenge the sonderweg question? How does his concept of eigensinn and by extension Alltagsgeschichte challenge sonderweg 
> [!recite|background-green] The 80 - Linguistic and post colonial turn  
> 
* Britain
	* Linguistics: Discursive practices in self-definition regarding groups, ideas, activities and opponents 
		* Competing conceptions of class.[^7] --> Cultural 
		* 1990s onwards - Demarcations between the political and the social
* Mainland Europe
	* Germany - Conceptual history (Begriffsgeschichte) - Reinhart Kosolleck 
		* Politics and political are categories and each have their own history 
	* Finnish
		* Comparative studies - Contingent emergence of the concept of political itself.[^8]
* From other disciplines
	* Gender historians: 
		* Constructivism used to question legitimization of sexual differences and their political construction. 
		* The political is redefined to reproduce gender hierarchy. 
		* The delineation of public vs private 
> Renewal of interest of specific national characteristics of political life like the pillarization thesis

> [!recite|background-green] The 90s onward - Visual and spatial turn 

* Germany: 
	* Cultural History of politics (Kulturgeschichte der Politik)
		* Use of metaphors and images to reinterpret political life in Weimar Republic

# The Bielefeld group 
Their focus: The political is a communicative sphere that is subject to change and varies through time and space. It is to historicise the mere concept of political and the things that surround it (p. 21). ==Explore the boundaries between political and non political and processes that make up these two== (p. 27)
Spheres are not presupposed and their emergence is examined, their delineation and boundaries as well and the presumed separation. 
*For further examples of works that examine this see ([[steinmetzPoliticalCommunicativeSpace2013|Steinmetz 2013]], 22 and 23)*
Main concerns (p. 23)
* Dynamics of politicisation and depoliticization 
* Spatial analysis.[^11]
* Communication. [^12]
	* Corruption
	* Violence 
Some conclusions from their work on ==how politicisation occurs== (p.25)
1. Deliberate verbal acts (Semantic acts)
* Labelling something political 
* In Open regimes this means that the issue will probably be political for a while
* depoliticization via verbal acts rarely has any effect. 
2. Symbolic and physical acts 
* Politicisation through this method does not always work
* Depoliticization here moves removing statues, symbols, etc
3. Attempted depoliticization and effective depoliticization
* Easy to study politization towards the bureaucracy/technocracy
