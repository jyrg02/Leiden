Overview of the biefield approach 
Beginning of the political 
* Top down approach (Traditional historians) --> High politics  
* Low politics (Social sciences) --> Civil society[^2], social movements. [^1] 
Cultural Turn:
* Annales: Before ww2. Focus on long durÃ©e, long term developments. Reject political history. History was defined as three layers. 
1. Structure --> Evenements 
	1. The daily basis of politics. The political sphere. Not of importance to them. 
2. Intermediate  --> Conjucture 
	+ Cycles. Usually economic and demographic developments 
3. Long period --> Structure; their main concern 
	+ [Study of the Mediterranean by Braudel](https://books.google.nl/books?hl=en&lr=&id=H27DEAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA657&dq=The+Mediterranean+and+the+Mediterranean+World+in+the+Age+of+Philip+II&ots=07h3u-kmE4&sig=c3UFYnEH4FXqnCv6ol-olvPRd6E&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=The%20Mediterranean%20and%20the%20Mediterranean%20World%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Philip%20II&f=false). 
		+ Geological structure determined the possibilities for societies to develop 
The 80s 
* Linguistic turn --> Foucault: Discourse analysis 
* Cultural: 
	* Studies on the FR revolution and the studies of myths and symbols
		* Useful for populism and fascism. 
	* Working class history 
	* Gender history 
Bielfield approach 
* There was an attempt in COVID to depoliticize through technocracy 
	* Starts with protests/violence 
	* Debates begin and leave a paper trail

Two schools
* Ethical superiority
* German idealist in opposition to civilization 
* Inherent cultural tension 
Tension between culture and civilization 
* Culture --> French enlightenment 
	* Hierarchical --> Different phases 
		* Changes through time and is connected to what people at the time think of culture 
		* Each volk had different terrritories and problems and therefore developed in different ways and therefore all cultures are equal.[^3] 
	* Bigger than states --> Connected to language (Volk-->Volkgeist)
	* Universalist and exclusionary (the only valid end point in history)
	* Typical topics: 
		* High culture: Art, lit, classical music, architecture  
		* Low culture/Banal form: 
			* Commercial: comics, videogames, pop music, Hollywood
			* Folklore: Traditional costumes, dancing, 
		* Anthropological --> Material, linguistic, ritual, ==traditions==Influenced the cultural study of politics in history which is mentioned by [[steinmetzPoliticalCommunicativeSpace2013]]. 
			* Study of traditions: What is taboo to them, childrearing 
			* They've been trying to move away from it towards transnational approach. Because:  
				1. Paternalistic/Superiority
				2. Neocolonial 
				3. Orientalist 
				4. The study presupposed static-ness 
				* Culture as a flow
				* Politized and now a days people see the traditional narrative of culture as islands whilst anthropologists have been moving towards 
# [[stormNewDawnNationalism2018]]
Origins of Nationalism
* Modernist: Imagined, invention, nation-building. Nations as a social construct (==constructivist==)
	* Well known authors
		* Benedict Anderson (IC) --> Invention of printing press 
		* Hobsbawm (Invention of Tradition) --> 
		* Gellner (Nations and Nationalism)
	* Nations as a social construct --> Constructivists[^4]
		* Very artificial --> 
			* Hobsbawm: Nationalism used to divide the working class 
		* Building blocks are already there and is used to reinforce: Anderson and Gellner 
* Anti-modernist view: 
	* Types.[^5] 
		* Constructivist: Modern nationalists already use strategies that existed. 
How do you define a nation 
* Ethnos - A culture --> Populism 
* Demos - Representation/those with the right passport [^6] --> Progressive politicians 
# Methdolodical nationalism 
* Data is collected at national level
	* Local history is hard because it requires very direct collection of data 
* Presumption of unity within the nation 
* Presummed uniqueness of each nation which nationalists already agree with 
*
