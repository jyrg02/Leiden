The Vaugh text takes a radically different approach to the perspective of nation-states, choosing to focus mostly on the evolution of the concept of culture. This focus on culture adheres to the approaches of the Biefield school which problematize the components that feed into the nation-state.[^1] This text is also particular in the way it incorporates the influence of contemporary events on theory development, with instances such as colonialism and race theory. Academics do not exist in a bubble and theories are influenced by and influence the world around them. The focus on the concept of culture also permits for the exploration of recent developments in the field regarding the culture of subjugated people.
A critique that is worth pointing out for both the Storm and Steinmetz texts is their focus on the construction of the nation-state. However early efforts of elements in the left wing of the political spectrum rejected the concept of the nation-state but did indeed believe in struggles of nations, as seen in the writing of Bakunin and Poland.[^2] [^3] The issue of Poland and Bakunin's support exemplifies the construction of a people, a nation without goal of a state.
