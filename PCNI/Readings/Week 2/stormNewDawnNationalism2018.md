> Nationalism studies does not seem to be a very innovative field of research. The path-breaking views of Anderson, Gellner and Hobsbawm – all published in 1983 – still form the starting point for almost all existing investigations. Moreover, most recent studies focus on one national case, which implicitly results in a vast collection of ‘unique’ trajectories. However, over the last few years a number of highly original studies on the origins of nationalism, nation-state formation, banal nationalism, methodological nationalism and nation-building in a global perspective seem to announce a new dawn. Some of these refreshing interpretations – which will be discussed in this article – clearly demonstrate that historiographical nationalism still has a preponderant role in history writing. In the concluding paragraphs I will emphasize the need to overcome not only methodological nationalism, but also the terminological and normative nationalism that still dominates our discipline.

Groundbreaking studies:
+ Benedict Anderson - Imagined Communities
+ Ernest Gellner - Nations and Nationalism
+ Eric Hobsbawm & Terence Ranger - The Invention of Tradition
A lot of research has been published, focus on national context makes it hard to get overview
# Origins of Nationalism 
* Modernist
	* Nations are closely related to the rise of modernity and not possible before modernity [^1]
	* New research combines the role of industralization resulting in the promotion of education and language standardization,[^4] along with the adoption of the printing press.[^5] In addition the cultural undermining of the royal authority through secularization.
* Specialists in Modern History 
	* National identities are found before the late 18th century. 
	* Continuity between national and older ethnic identities. [^2]
* Political Scientists
	* People are tribalistic and the therefore political ethnicity goes way back.[^3]
	* Critique of Anderson: Imagined communities can also be via spoken word, not just because of decline or religion and rise of print 
	* Gellner and Modernists: Focus on successful nation state as typical multi-national empires without dominant ethnic groups, like India and Habsburg. ==however this view ignores Spain==. 
	* This view is critiqued for over-emphasizing collective defence and linking it with nationalism
* Sociology 
	* Wimmer model: Nation states as a result of political modernization, product of modernity. State centralization is what allows nation-states to have success. Three outcomes 
		1. Nation states were the state suceeds in integrating the entire population 
		2. Populist nationalism where a dominant group along with the masses against a subordinate elite
		3. Ethnic enclosure: Each dominant and subordinate elites ally with their own groups
		* The rise of nation states is attributed to the success of new nation-states. 
		* Wars are more likely to occur during and after the transition to the nation-state model. 
# Nationalism in Every day life (Banal Nationalism)[^6].
>[!IMPORTANT] Will not be part of the readings 
* Social Scientists --> Mundane. Focus on recent periods.[^7] Asso ciated with post Second World War nation-states however some have contradicted this.[^8]  
	* Nationalism is banal in everyday experiences.[^6]
		* Hot and Cold nationalism 
		* General terms like government, economy and countryside imply our 
	* Trivial forms of nationalism have played a role since the 18th century. [^8]
	* Unintended nationalizing due to modernization or symbopls/practices are hard to study due to primary sources and their societal acceptance (are they representative enough)
		* Study of novels, dress, world fairs, champagne and Michelin (FR)
# Nationalism and its impact on methodology 
>[!note] The Nation-State model
>Borders of states overlap with nations. National culture is more dominant within the state but does not overlap with other nations (it stops at a nations borders). Residents should be citizens and participate in national culture (a uniform type of culture). [^14]
* Social sciences takes nation-states are granted[^9] 
	1. Social theory downplays its importance, sees it as backwards but also the world is divided by nation-states
	2. Society = National society --> Nation-states are the units under study 
	3. They cut out anything that extends beyond boundaries of nation-states 
* History
	* Dominance of ==Historiographical nationalism==.[^10]
		* Historians investigate, narrate and interpret history through a national lenses.[^11]
		* The origins of history account for this. The German origin during the romantic era professionalized the discipline but the intellectual climate at that times was enlightened universalism. German historians write to counter this and prioritze nations. National master narratives were constructed. The narratives focused around states or the people (if there was no nation-state present)
		* Impact: Interpretation of the European Wars of Religion through national perspectives and collective personality of the nation. Used to justify the rights of their own nation. ==Public history== has not reconciled with this trend. 
	* Brubaker[^12]
		* To define modernity there needs to be a criterion which ends up creating a single modernity 
		* Disagrees with the focus of nation-states and nationalism as elements in the interpretation of modernity 
		* Counters Tilly's theory.[^13] He states that social enclosure does not depend on categorical differences. ==One of the main instruments of social closure is citizenship==. Does not create inequality but perpetuates it. 
		* Implications of the Rise of the nation-state model: the nation state becomes a space of internal mobility while external mobility is framed as an an anomaly. Minority groups also become an anomaly. ==politics of belonging==
	* Berger and Alexei Miller. [^15] - Long 19th cent most nation-state are empires. Most nation states to be respected neaded overseas empire. Nations emerge within empires. Nation-building occurs within imperial context. 
		* FR: Direct links between Brittany, Corsica, Lyon and Marseille helped integrate these regions and cities into French nations. [^16] In napoleons empire civilization and uncivilized was set around the lines of the adoption of the Napoleonic code. National identities were not defined by language nor culture[^20]
		* SP: The loss of colonial empire led to direct stimulus for Catalan and Basque movements of independence.[^17]
		* GR: Racialization of the national discourse was related to the treatment of poles, Jews and colonial subjects.[^18]
		* RUS: No overlap between trad. nat-building political of the Tsar which focused on religion and dynastic loyalty and the liberal elites which wanted political participation.[^19]
		* DNK: Their collapse is due to the loss of Norway which led to the weakening of the nordic part of the population which supported the Oldenburg dynasty fell. [^21]
	* Healty and Dal Lago - Victims of imperial expansion within europe[^22]
# Further Work 
More work needed 
* The term nation has transformed 
* The Global success of nationalism. [^9]
* Impact of nationalism on everyday life. 
* Nation-state as a specific product of historical developments, not the only way of states and was not immediately dominant.
* Model: Nation-states resorted to repressive policies to create the supposed ideal nation state model.[^22] Trans-border migration undermine the cultural unity [^15]
* Nation-states and empires are not exclusive[^15]
Trends
* Critical of dominant position of nation states. However scholarship still focuses on nation-states. 
* Historical handbooks/public history still use the main territorial unit to structure their story. 
* Plays a normative framework were empire is backwards and nation-state is progress.
