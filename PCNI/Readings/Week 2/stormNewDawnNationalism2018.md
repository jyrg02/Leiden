> Nationalism studies does not seem to be a very innovative field of research. The path-breaking views of Anderson, Gellner and Hobsbawm – all published in 1983 – still form the starting point for almost all existing investigations. Moreover, most recent studies focus on one national case, which implicitly results in a vast collection of ‘unique’ trajectories. However, over the last few years a number of highly original studies on the origins of nationalism, nation-state formation, banal nationalism, methodological nationalism and nation-building in a global perspective seem to announce a new dawn. Some of these refreshing interpretations – which will be discussed in this article – clearly demonstrate that historiographical nationalism still has a preponderant role in history writing. In the concluding paragraphs I will emphasize the need to overcome not only methodological nationalism, but also the terminological and normative nationalism that still dominates our discipline.

Groundbreaking studies:
+ Benedict Anderson - Imagined Communities
+ Ernest Gellner - Nations and Nationalism
+ Eric Hobsbawm & Terence Ranger - The Invention of Tradition
A lot of research has been published, focus on national context makes it hard to get overview
# Origins of Nationalism 
* Modernist
	* Nations are closely related to the rise of modernity and not possible before modernity [^1]
	* New research combines the role of industralization resulting in the promotion of education and language standardization,[^4] along with the adoption of the printing press.[^5] In addition the cultural undermining of the royal authority through secularization.
* Specialists in Modern History 
	* National identities are found before the late 18th century. 
	* Continuity between national and older ethnic identities. [^2]
* Political Scientists
		* People are tribalistic and the refore political ethnicity goes way back.[^3]
		* Critique of Anderson: Imagined communities can also be via spoken word, not just because of decline or religion and rise of print 
		* Gellner and Modernists: Focus on successful nation state as typical multi-national empires without dominant ethnic groups, like India and Habsburg. ==however this view ignores Spain==. 
	* This view is critiqued for over-emphasizing collective defence and linking it with nationalism
* Sociology 
	* Wimmer model: Nation states as a result of political modernization, product of modernity. Statet centralization is what allows nation-states to have success. Three outcomes 
		1. Nation states were the state suceeds in integrating the entire population 
		2. Populist nationalism where a dominant group along with the masses against a subordinate elite
		3. Ethnic enclosure: Each dominant and subordinate elites ally with their own groups
		*  The rise of nation states is attributed to the success of new nation-states. 
		* Wars are more likely to occur during and after the transition to the nation-state model.
