Non-m
[ ] Fluid --> constructivist 
Methd9logucak nationalism: Tells a European story. Not country by country. Countries are used to demonstrate a broad development. He discusses internal disagreements within nations, looking at social groups. He doesn't make distinctions between North and South parts of Italy or such. There's a focus on the nation-state, the unit is that one. Be could have included a more non-homogenous 
[  ] The discussion of minorities don't rlly enter the discussion bc they can he viewed as nations in waiting. 
## Comparison
[  ] Countries
[  ] Ide9logical blocks--> The adoption of certain ideologies by their state. 
[  ] East vs west
[  ] Looks at differences but also discusses that there is some similitaries, the differences are more important. 
[  ] Similariti3s: family policy, the welfare state, economic crisis of the 30s and 70s. Consumerism. He makes the point that the reason democracies adopt welfare states is bc they have go compete with the Fascist family policies of social eugenics. 
[  ] It I'd an individualizing comparison in broad terms but looks for similarities when groupings democracies and communists. There's minor differences (3 types of welfare state). Bc he looks at differences within broac groupings it is an encompassing. 
[  ] Meso regions: east vs west 
## Transnational 
[ ] Ideas: ideologies (through soldiers with the racial theories of nazi Germany, Soviet imposition on satellite states, academics but he doesn't describe the process of academics). He kind of takes for granted the idea of welfare states and ideologies. 
[  ] People: refugees, soldiers, guest workes, immigrants, ethnic cleansing. They are more the victims and those who suffer. He doesn't pay any attention to the scholarship traveling, unlike Berger. 
[  ] Goods: Capital (martial aid), consumer goods (coca cola) --> in the americanization section. However odes not go into detail. In France the mega supermarket system was adopted, outside of cities model while in the netherlands it was adopted differently. The iron curtain was treated as a non permeable thing for goods. People did know of it but they couldn't access it. 
[  ] Could have put in more the influenced of colonies for Britain. After ww1. An example would be racial dynamics. Germany discouraged ethnic mixing in the colonies and the influx of polish migrants. France was interested in doing a French union but they had go choose the European process and left out the colonies, trade was made easier within the European Union but mot the colonies and therefore sped up the decolonizatiaonÂ process.
