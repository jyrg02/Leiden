>[!TLDR] Brief
>It is concerned with cross-border flows. It has its origins outside of historians. It gained traction in 90's, mirroring the academic interest of globalization. 
# What is Transnational History 
>[!note] Some definitions 
>Akira Iriye: The study of movement and forces that have cut across national boundaries
>Sven Beckert: Evolving approach taking as its starting point the interconnectedness of human history as a whole 

Main agreements: 
* Concern with cross-border flows -->Seminar: connected with Global history
	* People --> Seminar
	* Ideas  --> Seminar
	* Goods --> Seminar
	* Unlike global history transnational history does not necessarily include colonial interactions. 
* Nation: Encompassing the political unit not just the nation-state 
* Analysis on how people are the result of processes of exchange and circulation 
Origin
* Outside of history field, from other disciplines 
* Not restrict themselves to single case study 
Criticisms: 
* Some approaches are excessive lose and catch all. This accounts for the widespread use of the term
	* Can be an advantage to encourage pluralism. \
The Current state: 
* There is a tension between traditional historians and transnationalism. Current debates rage on adhering to existing methodologies that are used in traditional (local, national, regional) historiography (p.3)
## History of the Field 

>[!note] Evolution of term use
>Phenomena that occurred within a given nation. [^1]
>Widespread use traced to 1862. Term was used to refer to transnational languague families which encompassed particular national languages. [^2]
>Early 20th century the term is used to border-crossing. [^3]

The first academic use is in the political science. In the social sciences the term is used to refer to interactions ==across== state boundaries. The social sciences added the element that one of the participants must be a **non national actor.** This term grew in use as a response to the globalization topic in academia. 

Historians began to use the term as a response to the work of Akira Iraye's call in 1989. The academic concern of the time as well as the contemporary geopolitics contributed to its popularization. Within history transnational history aims to respond to two things
1. the link between history and nation-states, a term also known as ==national compartmentalization==. This challenges the narratives of the framework of nationhood. 
2. Comparative history is insufficient for transnationalism. As discussed by Jürgen Kocka, the very frame of comparative history assumes that entities can be separated. This process of separation however can lead to overstating the degrees of separation (p. 5). In addition it can lead to national exceptionalism and asymmetrical comparison. 
Comparative history studies supranational or subnational aspects of a phenomena. 
Notable concepts:
1. World History: Historical configuration that are world scale
2. Global Historry: History of Globalization 
3. Connnected history: Supra-local flows across political boundaries (Early modern Euroasian relations)
4. Histoire croisee: The points of crossing between different historical formations, 
5. Culture transfer: Not all cultural differences mirror national boundaries. The cultural differences that exist imply acculturation, and need to be understood by paying attention to the economic, technological and human methods of culture transfer. 
6. 
## Transnational history as separate from traditional historiographical approaches? 
1. Origins lie in traditional historiography
	* Local histories already used transnationalism to understand the local history in a broader context 
	* Non-traditional disciplines like class, gender and race already used transnationalist practices 
		* [World-Systems Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World-systems_theory) being an example [^4]
2. There is no inherent tension between transnationalism and the study of nationalism. 
# Current Works 
See document, pages 11-15
Some common topics are european integration, piracy, intellectural histories.
# Criticisms 
1. Overstate the efficacy of transnational phenomena
2. Must use a wide range of analysis and that the transnational narrative cannot be arranged around one centre nor give agency to all parties
3. The concept of nation and its origins is dubious and a whole field of study and therefore when can a study be called transnationalist. 
4. It is not concerned with the actual nation but with the elements below it such as intellectual or non-governmental actors. 
Arguments: 
* Transnationalism should not be an approach but simply a second-nature for average historians and considerations of other nations should be done when studying history.
