Trace back to John Stuart Mil. There was a need to study societies different from which scholars were familiar with. 
The rise of comparative studies coincides with two things 
1. Globalization -  Directed historians to pay attention to interlinkages 
2. The rise of nation states -  
>[!important] 
>Comparative historians construct homogenous identities and contrast them with another (p.171).
# Types of Comparison (p. 162-163)
 >[!note] Unit of measurement: 
 >*note*: The broader the unit the more specific the aspect of comparison needs to be 
* Nation states 
	* The 19th century is full of historians looking to ==legitimize== their nation state and doing so by ==comparing== it to other nation states and examining which traits made one nation ==superior== to another. 
 * Regions can also be a unit of measurement 

>[!note] Purpose/Objective
>![[PCNI - Types of Comparisons (Comparative History).png]]
* Individualizing: Demonstrate the uniqueness of one particular case when compared to others (*ej: american exceptionalism*) --> Case studies
	* Asymmetrical: Use a lot of cases to reveal more about the unit of study 
> Is a case study of one nation and ever so often there is a remark Gives international context to the event --> Seminar
* Universalizing: Identify similarities between cases --> Case studies 
	* Symmetrical: Give weight to all of the cases compared. 
>Tends to have 2 to 5 cases which are systematically compared either by country or by themes --> Seminar 
* Encompassing comparisons: Explaining differences between cases that share general commonalities (*ej: nationalism studies*)--> Not as useful according to Storm
* Variation-finding: Different cases are understood as one variation of a particular phenomena. (*ej: comparative fascism*) 
* Synchronic comparisons: Concerned with a particular event and ignoring historical antecedents (p. 167) --> Not as useful according to Storm
* Diachronic comparisons: Concerned with changes of concepts over a period of time. "Different times for different social contexts" (p. 167)
>[!note] Intentions 
* Detachment from object of study 
* Seeking to teach lessons of history. 
	* Moral judgments 
	* Reject assumption that historians should not judge.
# Comparative History's usefulness (p. 165)
1. Allows to distinguish good causal explanation from bad ones 
2. Capable of developing new models 
3. Draw attention that similar outcomes might have different causes and follow different patterns. 
4. Yield information on how similar developments produced different outcomes. 
# Pitfalls to avoid with comparative history 
1. Familiarity with the social contexts of the comparatives
* Archival sources: Rarely do we find sources that are comparable 
* Secondary literature: Different research traditions existed at different times and therefore historiographical comparisons must be done before any historical comparison. 
* Familiarity: It cannot be fostered by reading but must include staying in that social context. [^2]
2. Strict spatial and time delineations: Events occur within context
* Borders: *i*) meaning has changed with time *ii)* cannot be used as natural units of comparison 
* Time: Time specifically is tricky because concepts can develop at different points in time. 
3. Theoretical and conceptual frameworks need to be considered: 
* What units of comparison
* Must choose the cases and be aware of interrelated concepts.[^3] 
* Must be aware of the origins and politics of concepts. 
* Regarding frameworks and RQ one must avoid the issue of excess information and **==not narrativize==**. One must also obv choose the correct method of investigation.  
4. Linguistic pitfalls 
* Similar words can carry conotations and perceptions in one language that do not mirror in the other
# Cultural transfer studies 
>[!note] Author posits it as a challenge to comparative history
>See more about cultural transfer in [[macdonaldTransnationalHistoryReview2013|MacDonald, 2013]]

The main propontnets are Michael Werner and Michel Espagne regarding Franco-German studies. 
Cultural Transfer historians advocate:
+ Cultures are dialectical and there is an argumentative nature to the process 
+ National identity is formed by a feeling of belonging, that belonging is created by othering. Appropriation and rejection therefore are the same coin. 
They focus: 
1. Groups suited for mediation (authors, publishers, migrants, etc.)
2. Opportunities to travel 
3. Borders
+ Demarcation - Sites of confrontation
+ Appropriation: Point of confluence 
Methodology 
 The other becomes embedded and requires archaeological capacity to bring the connections to light again. 
+ Transmitters need to be identified
+ Means of transmission needs to be identified. 
>note: The History of a scholarship is considered appropriate because scholar communities during the 19th and 20th century underwent a process of internationalization. 
# Tensions
>[!TLDR]
>The main debate lies on the unit of measurement. 

Cultural transfer breaks down units to see how they interact with each other 
Comparative form units to contrast it with another.

# Notes
Not all countries studies/benefit from comparative history. For example Britain has not really seen this but America has benefited greatly. 
Some motivation for historians is that studying a problem or theme allows them to draw up typologies of how similar socieites dealt with the issue 
They might also be able to ask whether or not similar problems occurred in other societies [^1]

[^1]: For example the focus on solely national issues lead to the hiding of the development of a european national identity. 
[^2]: An example is that we can read about national founding myths but cannot always understand their function or impact on the nation state 
[^3]: An example is explaining nationalism. One cannot use enmity towards foreigners and willingness to defend one's country against foreign invasion as explanation because those explain the degrees of nationalism.
