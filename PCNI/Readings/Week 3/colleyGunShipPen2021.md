> "A groundbreaking work that retells modern history through the rise and spread of written constitutions-some enlightened, many oppressive-to every corner of the globe. Filling a crucial void in our understanding of world history, Linda Colley reconfigures the rise of the modern world over three centuries through the advent of written constitutions. Her absorbing work challenges accepted narratives, focusing on rulers like Catherine the Great, who wrote her enlightened Nakaz years before the French Revolution; African visionaries like Sierra Leone's James Africanus Beale Horton; and Tunisias's soldier-constitutionalist Khayr-al-Din, who championed constitutional reform in the Muslim world. Demonstrating how constitutions repeatedly evolved in tandem with warfare, and how they were used to free, but also exclude, people (especially women and indigenous populations), this handsomely illustrated history-with its pageant of powerful monarchs, visionary lawmakers, and insurrectionist rebels-evokes The Silk Roads in its range and ambition. Whether reinterpreting the lasting influence of Japan's 1889 Meiji constitution or exploring the first constitution to enfranchise women in tiny Pitcairn Island in 1838, this book is one of the most original and absorbing histories in decades"--

# Reading observations 
Enlightenment documents used as propaganda to justify war (79)
Essential, what destinguishes constitution from non-constitution is the monarch also binding himself to it (81)
The examples of sweden and russia account as to why the word constitution is used in the american case, because the langauge was already in circulation p. 81 
## Haiti 
Does not give it equal weight. The comparative features of Haiti are used to reaffirm points that the author wants to make regarding Europe.  p. 49
### Poliitcs
Attributes the writing of 
the attention they (enlightment writers) paid to different parts of the globe and to the operation of power and military violence were vital aspects of their appeal to those in high office p.57
that in an age of rampant, expensive and disruptive military violence on land and sea, innovatory and informed legislators might intervene so as to bind up society’s wounds, re-establish order, remodel their respective states p. 58
### Russia 
Catherine accepts and begins the nakaz because she needs to cement her position p. 64. Her position was tenous because she was not russian and had no claim by blood to the throne p. 65
For the author the thing that makes a constitution is when the ruler binds themselves to it 
The nation state is expanded through conquest 
"Enhancing Russia’s stock of human resources, its future workers and taxpayers – and its future soldiers – would be part of her rationale for later annexing the Crimea, and for invading and pro‐ gressively carving up Poland after 1772, acquiring in the process an extra 7 million or so subjects" p. 68
CAtherine never used the word constitution in her text. p. 73
### Sweden 
The use of citizen is used by gustaf. To  say fellow citizens. he also then goes on to link king and citizen together "as a king, as a citizen" (p. 80) 
The suposed constituion however did not prevent him fro totalitarianist tendencies of sizing more power. This was in turn used to kill him because people were unhappy by the war with Russia (p. 82)/ *the author does not go on to comment why people were unhappy or why the system built by gustaf was not able to get the nobles opinions into the discourse with the king, it simply states he was totalitarian in his approach. A very handfisted approach*
- It seems that what the author considers a constitution lies on whether or not the monarch binds themselves to it 
## Chapter 2: Into Revolutions
### America
Her example of Tomas Paine makes no methodological sense. She has so far adopted a high politics approach, looking mostly at aspects like hard power, and some soft power as a motivation for rulers for constitutions and rights. However when applying the case for America this framing is abandoned with no reason. The author suddenly begins to discuss the way Britain and its Magna Carta influenced Tomas Paine's thoughts, shifting the focus from power to ideological lenses (p. 88). There is no reasoning as to why this shift of focus is justified, apart that Tomas Paine was unlike the others the author discussed. There is also no reasoning as to why Tomas Paine was chosen. Upon context it is true that Tomas Paine wrote Common Sense and this was influential for Revolutionary support but this is not elaborated in the beginning, when the author discusses Mr. Paine. 
She notes that one of the key factors for success of the american experiment is the close connection it had with printers (p. 102)
The people who participated in the american revolution and were part of the constitutional convention were in the 40 and therefore had seen the 7 years war [^2];. If they weren't military men they were still high up. Cooley uses this to justify this as to why the constitution does not reflect a liberal democratic society. This defense is somewhat weak, making it seem like an active concious choice that delegates took instead of the mere fact that they disagreed with a "liberal democratic society". In fact Hamilton in one of his letters disagreed with generalz enfranchaisement.[^3]
It is wroth pointing out that the author does not dispel the notion of America having a constitution, regardless of the enfranchisement it gave people, which was dependant on property. 
==The author attributes the success of the revolution to the print, the declaration of INDP was short and therefore permitted the wide-spread reading of it==.[^4] Cooley justifies the reasoning for printing as wanting to have wealthy players in foreign places to be impressed by the languages and ideas of the constitution and therefor not invade from abroad and entice foreign investment. [^5] 
>[!warning] The declaration of INDP 
>Cooley makes the point that The INDP was a niche document and that it was only attractive to South America and that outside the America it was not captivating. Which is a very condescending attitude, Cooley does not consider the Americas on the same importance as European states. 
### South America
Not very equal comparison however mention that they sent the constitution 

### Ireland 
The irish printed their constitution along with copies of other constitutions in a bound volume, Cooley argues that this was a deliberate calculati0on and that it meant to give foundations to a unstable nation.[^7]  A cursory glance at mentions of this text, the book does not seem to have had much impact, in the sense that there is not a lot of academic work dedicated to it 
### Norway 
Idea transfer --> Ideas come from paris, specifically from Copenhagen. 
### Limitations of constituions
The fact that they were printed meant that in literate places, even those that couldnt read could rely on their more educated neightbours. However in less educated areas the literacy issue prevented further spread into more rural areas.[^10]
In addition the fact that these were written did not mean that their spread was guaranteed, it was very much also dependant on the willingness of the authorities. One example is china, where it wasn't until they had pressures like needing to raise taxes and reorder the state that they actually reconsidered things. 
Hard power dominated over the print, as seen as well with the native americans in   Sometimes forces has needed to be used to reinforce new constitutions. Especially seen in Napoleon Bonaparte. 
### The discussion on paper 
The comparative section where she discusses the south american states is extremely unfair, she discusses them only in terms of america, to explain how they reflect america and does not dedicate any time to their discussion.[^6]
## Ch: 3 - Armies of Legislators 
### France
Different from US: 
1. Fix the constitution of the us, the bill of rights.[^11]
2. Hollowed out executive power and adopted unicameral model.[^11]
Constitutions: 
1. Attracted informal practitioners
2. Sometimes the reform was not simply a reform on a government of the homeland, planned for other territories 
People were ==politized== by the spread of the constituion and insipiring scripts.[^12]

# Assignment notes
## Politics
The author views politics through a high politics lense. The text for example with catherine discusses very much government and the issues that move Catherine towards making the nakaz as pressures from the outside, threats to her position. The text acknowledges the influence of the enlightenment but does not go into depth with it. The author also contradicts themselves later on when they state that "Catherine initially planned to use the nakaz to ease the conditions of these people"[^1] (referring to the serfs, women, non-noble). It seems like the author wants to discuss both aspects of high and low politics but the main thesis they want to put forth, that constitutions and war go hand in hand, does not favour this mixed framing. 
## Nationalism 
Constitutions can be used to establish themselves and promote and define themselves across the globe.[^8]
Certain constitutions were used to define citizenship, for example in Mexico the lack of distinction between european, africans or indians.[^9]
