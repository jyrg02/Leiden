**High politics**

* Historians as nation-builders by defining the story of the nation (its origin, development, national character) --> Legitimize the state. 
	* **==Opposition==**. 
		* Nations without a state: Breakaway regions used history to reinforce their own differences 
		* Socialism, fascism, communism
	* Self-definition
	* Othering: countries and populations
>historians according to storm are part of public society and try to influence public opinion through state activity. 

Historians in the 19th century try to professionalize history and attempt to make it neutral however through that historians made their implicit political goal even stronger. Berger would agree that one cannot write history without being political while Ranke would disagree, stating that history can be apolitical.

# Nationalism
Berger takes a nuanced position. Stating that its not out of the blue but that there is a reason why it becomes popular, modenrity, which puts him in the school of modernism. 
Constructivism
