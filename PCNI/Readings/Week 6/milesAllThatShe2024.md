Clothing is particular because it was used as a social indicator. Black women engaged with it but also produced it, both in weaving but also by collecting cotton p. 148

# Politics
Low politics: Civil society in the sense of enslaved people. A society that is not seen and did not have a very active say within the political sphere. It is as very non-traditional approach to politics. 
The interpretation of politics from the unseen, the example of Charleston being a city of freedom from religious persecution yet it was the hub for slavery. 
* Politization: Yes. Dress and fashion. Laws were made about it 
# Culture
Black culture such as hairstyle, clothing, objects. Southern culture is discussed but not at the forefront, the focus remains on how the culture of the south served further to opress black people. 
It looks at low culture, it does not adopt an anthropological lense 
**Nationalism** 
Unconventional. It adopts a perspective in which the national narrative of America is defied, a story in which America was not free. The narrative provided provides an image in which a opressed people developed culture and history despite the attempts of slave owners to deprive them of it. 
As a result of the unconventioanl narrative there is no mention really of mondernist, anti-modernist or constructivist. 
**Transnational**: Not necessarily trans-national since it only discusses america but it does adopt an intersting lense regarding slaves. Slaves were people but at the same time goods, at least to the white people. The intersection between these meant that selling and buying them involved the movement of ideas and culture, the people that were sold still carried with them their past. Therefore while not across nations, transnationalism is an aspect of the book. 
Comparison: 
there is comparison, mostly among the experiences of black women. The comparisons are universalizing
